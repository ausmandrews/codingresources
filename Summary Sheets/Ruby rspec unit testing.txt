RSPEC UNIT TESTING

## SETUP ##

INSTALL CORRECT GEMS
gem install rspec
gem install respec-its

rspec --init
# create a spec directory where "specs" go
# do this from root directory

ROOT FOLDER
# select root folder with "spec" subfolder (holding tests)
# execute: "rspec" from this root folder to run unit tests

SETUP
require 'test/unit' (MiniTest Only)

OR

require 'rspec'
require 'rspec/its'

AND
require_relative 'file_to_be_tested'

## TERMINAL COMMANDS ##

rspec
#runs all unit tests in spec subdirectory.

rspec --format documentation
# prints descriptors of each test / passing or failing

## EXPRESSIONS ##

RSPEC CORE

describe()
# "Describe" used to express concepts like a conversation
# A set of related tests
# top level method - no class: everything happens inside describe method

it()
# declare examples using the "it" method
# used to define the ACTUAL Rspec specifications - i.e. examples
# takes an OPTIONAL string that describes the behaviour being tested

e.g.

MEANING
"Describe an order" 
"It sums the prices of its line items"

CODE
RSpec.descrive Order do
  it "sums the prices of its line items" do
    ...
  end
end

RSPEC EXPECTATIONS

expect(...).to
expect(...).not_to 

# used to define positive or negative expectations.
# e.g. expect (result).to eq(3)

(...).should
# define expectation

is_expected.to 
# Rspec way of measuring expectations

MATCHERS

to() / not_to()
# takes single matcher parameter
# example matcher parameters
# - be_true
# - be_false
# - eq 3
# - raise_error(SomeError)

be_predicate matchers
# if obj has a PREDICATE (boolean) method; you AUTOMATICALLY get a be_predicate matcher
# example be_predicate:
# be_even, be_odd

respond_to(:method_name)
# very basic test that a a subject is expected to respond to a given method method_name

METHODS - RSPEC

before()
# code to execute before any testing
# can pass in :all or :each

after()
# can pass in :all or :each

METHODS - MINITEST

setup()
# sets up behaviour that will execute before every test method

teardown()
# make sure to tear it down as well, blank slate code prior to new suite of tests
