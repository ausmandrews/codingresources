COMMAND LINE NOTES - (Linux based user systems ONLY: Linux and Mac OS X - not command Prompt)

command prompt is called a 'terminal'
an 'argument' is a term / directory etc handed into a command

$ - this is the 'shell prompt'
ls - lists all files and directories in CURRENT directory.
pwd - print working directory.
cd [directoryname] - change directory, directoy name
cd .. - changes directory, moving up one level
cd ../[directorypath] - moves up one level then hops into [directorpath] (locally written)
mkdir [directoryname] - make directory called [directoryname]
touch [newfilename] - adds a new file called [newfilename].extension to the current directory.
cp [file1] [file2] - copies contents of file1 into file2
cp [file1] [file2] ... [directory] - creates brand new copies of source files into directory
cp * [directory] - copies all files in current directory
cp [W]*[ext (.txt)] [directory] - copies all files starting with [W] and ending with given extention [ext] into directory.

ALL 'mv' COMMANDS HOLD FOR 'cp'. USE AS DIRECTED ABOVE, EXCEPT:

mv [file1] [newfile] - renames file1 [newfile] in same directory.
rm [file1] - PERMANENTLY deletes file
rm -r [directory] - PERMANENTLY deletes directory, -r is "recursive", meaning to delete all children directories and files as well!


**these commands can be combined in compound ways**

ls -a - list with all hidden files (files that begine with '.')

OPTIONS - can be applied to any command...

-a - (lists all contents) including hidden files and directories.
-l - (lists all contents) of a directory in long format
e.g. drwxr-xr-x 5  cc  eng  4096 Jun 24 16:51  action
     access rights / number hard links / user / user group / size / date modified / name
-t - order files and directories by the time they were last modified.

combine like : -alt

I/O INPUT OUTPUT REDIRECTION

stdin - standard input - information input into terminal through keyboard or input device.
stdout - standard output - information output after a process is run
stderr - standard error - standard error message output by failed process.

...redirection will reroute stdin, stdout or stderr to or from different locations..!

echo "Hello" - stdout "Hello" in the terminal.
echo "test" > test.txt - redirects "test" into file test.txt
cat [filename] - prints all contents of [filename]
cat [file1] > [file2] - OVERWRITES file2 with all the content of file1
cat [file1] >> [file2] - ADDS all the content of file1 to end of file2
command < [file3] - File3 becomes standard input for a given command!
wc - outputs lines / words / characters
sort - arranges items in alphabetical order

| "pipes" - pipes initial command into second command.
e.g. cat volcanoes.txt | wc | cat > islands.txt
pipes the first command combination ""XX | "wc" into "cat"
uniq [file] - deletes adjacent items in file that are duplicates. i.e. "unique"
sort [file] | uniq - deletes all duplicates in file (by piping into sort command first, 
then all duplicates are adjacent!)

grep stands for "global regular expression print"
grep ABcd [file] - returns only terms with ABcd within the file.
grep -i ABcd [file] - returns only terms with abcd (CASE INSENSITIVE) within the file.
grep -R "string" /file/path - returns FILES with stating lines containing "string" (-R - Recursive)
grep -Rl "string" /file/path - returns Files only, based on containing "string" (-l - files with matches only)

sed s/"find string"/"replace string"/g [file]
sed - "stream editor"
s - substitution (always with find/replace strings)
g - [optional] - global, replaces all strings that match, rather than the first in each line.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETUP

nano [filename] - opens simple text editor for a given file.
prompts will ebe displayed below for the given program.

clear - clears terminal for a restart.
history - view all historically called commands.
less [filename] - as for cat, only better at handling bigger files. requires a 'q' to quit

$ nano ~/.bash_profile - known as the "bash profile" that contains the profile settings. 
It will know to load the settings when the terminal is openned.
. - makes the file hidden.
~ - is the user's home directory

source ~/.bash_profile - activates settings for use immediately (no need to close and enter again)
alias [newcommand]= "[parentcommand]" - allows a custom shortcut to be created for the parent command

[NAME]="String" - this will define a variable.
export [NAME]="String" - makes variable allow 
$[NAME] - always required to return the value of the variable.
export PS1="Userdecide" - manually changes terminal prompt to "Userdecide"
echo $HOME - home filepath directory
echo $PATH - lists all directories separated by :
**note that the bin directory holds a bunch of commands**
env - lists all environmental variables (variables used across PROGRAMS and COMMANDS)
