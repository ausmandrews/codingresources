GIT COLLABORATION WORKFLOW - GREAT FOR LARGE TEAM WORK!!!
1. Fetch and merge changes from the remote
2. Create a branch to work on a new project feature
3. Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work
4. Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working)
5. Push your branch up to the remote for review

git push origin your_branch_name
- will push your branch up to the remote, "origin". 

git push -u origin master
